# AirBnB Clone Project

## Description

This project is the first step in building an AirBnB clone web application. We're creating a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. This interpreter lets us perform actions like creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting objects. We're also making classes for AirBnB objects, like Users, States, Cities, and Places, and creating a storage engine for file storage. We'll write tests to make sure everything works.

## Usage

1. Clone the project repository.
2. Go to the project directory.
3. Run the command interpreter with `python3 console.py`.

Now you can use the command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects.
